# File I/O

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. The project is on the **Binary Tree** done with **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-binary_tree_node.c` | function that creates a binary tree node |
| `1-binary_tree_insert_left.c` | function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node |
| `2-binary_tree_insert_right.c` | function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node |
| `3-binary_tree_delete.c` | a function that deletes an entire binary tree |
| `4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c` | a function that checks if a node is a leaf |
| `5-binary_tree_is_root.c` | a function that checks if a given node is a root |
| `6-binary_tree_preorder.c` | a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal |
